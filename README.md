# Scotland Deaths

24 Sep 2021

Covid currently appears to contribute only 50% of all excess death relative to the 5 year average. This script 
downloads the latest National Records of Scotland data on Covid deaths and analyses metrics.

Covid and other causes of death are published by The National Records of Scotland at 
https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats

The Government publishes "detailed analysis", which uses this data:
https://data.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/detail.html

This "detailed analysis" notes that excess deaths have risen, and that Covid deaths have risen.
It does not make clear that Covid deaths are only a fraction (this week, c. 50%) of all deaths.

QUESTION: Where are they occurring?
QUESTION: Is there evidence that non-Covid deaths are higher?
QUESTION: Is there evidence that non-Covid deaths are being mis-coded as Covid deaths?
